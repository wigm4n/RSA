# RSA implementation included:

1. Own long arithmetic
2. Prime number verification method: Millerâ€“Rabin primality test
3. Closed exponent generation method: Extended Euclidean algorithm

Algorithm work in reasonable time up to 128 bits. (Around 7 seconds for 64 bits, around 45 seconds for 128 bits).
